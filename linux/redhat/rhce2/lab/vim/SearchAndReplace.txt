README.txt for version 7.4 of Vim: Vi IMproved.


DISTRIBUTION

There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
This README.txt file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
want or must compile it yourself.  Check "http://www.vim.org/download.php" for
an overview of currently available distributions.


COMPILING

If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
"src" directory.  See src/INSTALL for instructions.
