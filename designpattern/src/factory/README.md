# Factory

有 3 種工廠

## Simple Factory Pattern
> Define an interface for creating an object, it through the argument to decide which class to instantiate.

- 違反 OCP


## Factory Method Pattern
> Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.


## Abstract Factory Pattern
> Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
